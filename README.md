# POV-Globe
Making a 3d hologram using apa102 led and the optical illusion called Persistence Of Vision(aka POV)


## Persistence of vision
refers to the optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays
of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye.
The illusion has also been described as "retinal persistence","persistence of impressions" or simply "persistence".

## Goals
In this project i will try to attempt and create a 3d hologram "effect" that uses the optical illusion called Persistence Of Vision.
